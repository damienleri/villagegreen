# Village Keep

This is the source code for the React Native mobile app whose home page is http://villagekeep.com.

To run locally you need to set up your own AWS resources.

# yarn

# yarn global add amplify-cli

# amplify configure (this creates aws-exports.js and other local files)

# expo start
